The EC is also responsible for implementing some of the ACPI functions, such as sleep and wake modes, lid status, and battery events. The EC communicates with the main CPU through a system management bus (SMBus), which is a subset of I2C. The EC can send commands and data to the CPU, and vice versa. The EC can also generate system management interrupts (SMIs) to notify the CPU of urgent events, such as power button press or low battery.

The EC firmware is usually stored in a separate flash memory chip, which can be either SPI or LPC. The EC firmware is independent of the BIOS firmware, which is stored in another flash memory chip and executed by the main CPU. However, the EC firmware and the BIOS firmware may interact with each other through some shared memory regions or registers. For example, the BIOS may read the keyboard scan code from the EC, or write some configuration data to the EC.
 
The EC firmware is typically written in C or assembly language, and compiled using a specific toolchain for the target microcontroller. The EC firmware may also include some proprietary libraries or drivers provided by the EC vendor or the laptop manufacturer. The EC firmware may be updated by flashing a new image to the flash memory chip, either through a dedicated utility or through the BIOS update process.
 ```  ``` 
While the EC firmware is usually proprietary and closed-source, some laptop manufacturers have decided to open-source their EC firmware and allow users to modify and customize it. For example, System76 has released the source code of their EC firmware for several laptop models, and provides a guide on how to build and flash it. Framework has also open-sourced their EC firmware for their modular laptop, and encourages users to hack it and share their modifications.
 
Hacking the EC firmware can enable users to add new features or fix bugs in their laptops. For example, one can change the fan speed curve, adjust the keyboard backlight brightness, or implement custom LED indicators. However, hacking the EC firmware also comes with some risks and challenges. One has to be careful not to brick the EC or damage the laptop hardware. One also has to deal with the complexity and diversity of the EC hardware and software platforms, which may vary significantly across different laptop models and vendors.
 
Therefore, hacking the EC firmware requires some skills and knowledge in embedded systems development, reverse engineering, and hardware debugging. It also requires some tools and equipment, such as a flash programmer, a logic analyzer, or a multimeter. Moreover, it requires some patience and curiosity, as well as a willingness to learn from others and share one's findings. Hacking the EC firmware can be a rewarding and fun experience for those who are interested in exploring the inner workings of their laptops.
